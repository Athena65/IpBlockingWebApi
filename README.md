# IpBlockingWebApi
This Api Blocks or Allows an Ip Address through a Middleware. After implementing code You should install ngrok and type : "ngrok http https://localhost:Your Application Address" . And after that u should add ngrok web site Ip into appsettings.json to the "BlockedIPs":"" . If you do that and try to visit website you will get 403 Forbidden Error . And Ip Blocking works like that!
